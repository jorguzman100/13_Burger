## The challenge

To create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Use the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Main elements:

- [x] MySQL
- [x] Node and Express
- [x] Handlebars

## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were done:

1. Understand the purpose, concept of the application.
2. Create the database schema.
3. Define functionality.
4. Research assets.
5. Include dependencies.
6. Develop the functionality.
7. Final review and proper documentation.

## The Output

With the described process we were able to create an application that allows the user to create their favorite burgers list, then define which of them to devoure. Additonally, to request one of the same devoured kind and finally to delete any burger from the lists.

**User stories**

1. As a user I can add a burguer to the list, so thet it can be devoured later.
2. As a user I can click to devour a burger, so I have a record of what I have eaten.
3. As a user I can delete burgers from any list, so I can have a updated list.
